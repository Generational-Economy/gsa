# Generational Satellite Accounts (GSA) combine National Accounts and micro-data to be able to analyse income, taxes, benefits, consumption and saving by demographic characteristics
# The code allows users to control and replicate results that are generated using GSAs

# The whole project consists of 4 interconnected but distinct components

# 1. Aggrgate data
# Using publicly available data we derive information on income, taxes, benefits, consumption and saving for the total economy. All of the data sources are publicly available.

# 2. Micro data
# Mainly survey-based data that allows estimations how income, taxes, benefits, consumption and saving are distributed by socio-economic characteristics of individuals. The micro-data sources are not publicly available, but results can be replicated by anyone who has access to the data.

# 3. Data explorer
# Aggregate data and age-specific data can be analysed using a data explorer based on shiny. 

# 4. Specific analysis of the data
# GSAs enable very interesting data-analysis, for which we will provide the code.
